    <p id="gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi was India's pivotal freedom fighter, known as the "Father of the Nation," who used non-violent resistance, or Satyagraha, and the philosophy of Ahimsa (non-violence) to lead India's independence movement against British rule. His leadership inspired movements like the Salt March and the Quit India Movement and promoted social reforms against untouchability and for the use of Indian goods. Gandhi's legacy continues to influence global movements for peace, justice, and human rights.
